    <h2>Sumarry</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I have been working in Digital for 12 years, 7 years in team management, sales and monetization of digital products, and I like to look for new challenges and gain new skills.
    I can develop the best solution based on trends and data, create an idea and bring it to life.
    I have experience in operations management, accounting, sales, project management, and
    teamwork (designers, developers, editors, financiers, etc.). I am an effective communicator
    both online and offline. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I love planting seeds (ideas) in people's heads and watching them
    grow and make an impact. It's extremely exciting and playful for me every time! And I know
    that this attitude works and produces positive results for both parties.
    Right now I'm particularly inspired by Edtech, Mental Health, FemTech and FinTech. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I would love to join a team of people who share the same spirit and values as I do - humanity,
    respect, support, strong professional skills, self-identity and responsibility. I believe that every
    case has a solution, and it's important that everyone involved knows what we're aiming for and works with respect, perseverance and motivation as part of the team, works cohesively
    and is ready for change at short notice. I welcome reasonable subordination and autonomy
    in the performance of job duties. I love my family, traveling, urban gardening, jazz music, psychology and meeting fascinating people.
